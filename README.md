# Name My Pet
This app primarly uses Firebase API and JavaScript to store the users favourite Pets Names and output a carefully crafted list of popular, food, mystical, and wacky pet names. By using Firebase authentication I was able to connect the logged in user to the main page where they would then be promted to sort through different types of pet names and favourite them for later.
